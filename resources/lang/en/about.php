                            that sought to give added value to fruit crops
                            of the producers of the Tequendama region.
                            Thus, they devised different transformation processes to
                            produce 100% natural products such as frozen pulp fruit,
                            jams and sweets, all made from fruits of the region.",

                            farmers of the region to produce our products.
                            We seek to promote the values ​​of fair trade,paying them a legitimate 
                            price for their harvest,regardless of the season. In this way, the 
                            peasants worry solely by harvesting the highest quality fruits without 
                            having the constant anguish to sell them. On the other hand, we seek to 
                            teach them to European consumers about Colombian exotic fruits and put 
                            at your disposal 100% natural food products. So, we want to create ties
